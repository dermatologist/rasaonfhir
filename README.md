# rasaonfhir

[FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. Searching for resources is fundamental to the mechanics of FHIR. Search operations traverse through an existing set of resources filtering by parameters supplied to the search operation.

[Rasa](https://rasa.com/) is an open-source machine learning framework for building AI assistants and chatbots. You can create custom actions with Rasa to support various use-cases.

This repository is a RASA project for **mapping conversations to FHIR search.** This can be extended to allow **doctors to TALK to their EMRs**.

This is experimental for now. Pull request, welcome!
